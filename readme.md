# Company Handbook

Welcome to the company handbook of DataCater.

In this repository, you can find many information about our company,
e.g., its [story](https://github.com/DataCater/handbook/blob/master/story.md),
its culture,
[internal](https://github.com/DataCater/handbook/tree/master/processes.md) and
[hiring](https://github.com/DataCater/handbook/tree/master/hiring_process.md) processes,
and [open positions](https://github.com/DataCater/handbook/tree/master/careers).

Transparency is an essential value to us.
We believe that great products and companies are built in environments
of trust and freedom, where human beings can perform deep work, thrive, and flourish. That
is why we make this handbook public.

Our public product roadmap is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DataCater/public-roadmap/projects/1).

Feel free to look around, ask questions, or make proposals for changes.
