# Processes

From the very beginning, DataCater is a remote-first company. We
don't ask our team to commute to the same office every day but allow
everyone to work from the place of their choice.

Being a remote-first company has a few implications on our internal
processes, which we share in this document.

## Communication

Working at different geographical locations and in potentially-different
time zones makes synchronous communication nearly impossible.

At DataCater, we favor asynchronous communication, which has the
positive side effect that all communication is available to anyone, even
to
those who could not join a conversation.

We use Google Workspace for our main communication. It allows us to write text documents, work on spreadsheets,
etc. and share these documents with the rest of the team.

For instant communication, we rely on Slack. We run a Slack
community with different private channels, such as `#dev`, `#marketing`, or `#company`. By the way, most of our users and customers
are also onboarded to our Slack.

## Tools

We use the following tools on a daily basis:

* GitHub (Code collaboration)
* Google Workspace (Collaboration)
* Slack (Instant communication)
* Zoom and Google Meet (Video meetings)
* HubSpot (CRM)
* Zendesk (Customer support)
* Calendly (Appointment scheduling)
