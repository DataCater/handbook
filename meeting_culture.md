# Meeting Culture

As a remote-first company, we aim to minimize synchronous communication and therefore meetings.
We believe that human beings can be most productive and creative when
being able to perform deep work on their own schedule without being
interrupted.

## General Meeting Guideline

DataCater employees are expected to be the best judges of their time spent and attention given. Therefore, if an invite is send out, every participant can and must expect the following things in the invite:

- Right to an agenda that clearly states goals and resources for preparation.
- A defined host, which will guide through the meeting.
- Right to listen in.
- A link to a Google Doc to gather ideas and document outcomes.

## Daily Standups

We don’t do synchronous standups but have a Slack channel, `#standup`, where each team member is asked to answer the following two questions when they start their working day:

- What am I working on today?
- Do I face any blockers?

Participating in the asynchronous standup is mandatory, because it strongly helps us to stay bonded despite being physically separated.

## All-Hands Meeting

Mondays at 5pm CEST, we have an all-hands company-wide meeting, where the leadership team shares updates and all participants can ask questions. All-hands meetings are prepared in a Google Doc - if possible - to enable participants to prepare questions on the updates. Participation in the all-hands meeting is optional.

## 1:1 Meetings

All full-time team members have weekly 1:1 meetings with their manager (part-time team members might agree on a bi-weekly schedule with their manager).

In 1:1s, managers ask the following four questions:

- What’s on your mind this week?
- How happy were you this past week?
- How productive were you this past week?
- What feedback do you have for me?

We use 1:1s as a way to stay in touch with each other beyond daily work activities. They are also helpful to track the development and performance of team members over time. 1:1s are mandatory and typically take 15 to 30 minutes.

## Team Building

As remote workers, it’s easy to get drowned in work and forget to socialize with colleagues.
Fridays at 1 pm CEST, we meet in a Zoom call to hangout and play games together. Participation in this meeting is optional but always lots of fun.
