# Hiring Process

We try our best to make our hiring process as efficient as possible, for
both sides.

Our **hiring process for an engineering role** is structured into three
steps:

- **First call (45 minutes):** Introduction call with a focus on whether DataCater and you are a cultural fit.
- **Second call (90 minutes):**
Technical interview discussing a take-home exercise, which has to be solved beforehand.
In this call, we try to validate whether you bring everything needed to technically excel at the position you applied for.
We will NOT ask you to perform live coding during the interview.
- **Third call (30 minutes):** Final call discussing our offer for you.

Do you have questions regarding our hiring process? Please send your
question to hr@datacater.io.
